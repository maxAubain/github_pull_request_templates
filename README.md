# Github Pull Request Templates
## Summary
By placing a text file `pull_request_template.md` in select areas of a repository, the text file content will be automatically populated in the first comment of every subsequent pull request.  Collaborators can also use pull request template files if the pull request is being merged with the default branch of the repository.

Feel free to fork and modify as you like!

## Acceptable `pull_request_template.md` file locations within the repository
- `/...`
- `/docs/...`
- `/.github/...` # This location will keep the template file hidden
